You’ve been asked to serve as a product lead at 18F — now what? This guide will
walk you through what it’s like to be a product lead at 18F and offer some tools
you can use along the way. Whatever tools you decide to use are up to you and
your team.

Product leads are regularly learning lessons throughout their project’s
lifecycle. Please share lessons learned with your peers so that we may all
benefit from them. Sharing what you learn means our team only has to solve a
problem once.  Whether you add that information here or write a blog post —
your avenue for sharing it is up to you!
