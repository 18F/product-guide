18F product managers join cross-functional teams to ensure successful delivery and that user-centered, agile approaches guide product strategy. The 18F Product Guide is a starting point for consulting Product Managers at 18F.

**18F Product Guide** is primarily written for internal product managers, but we hope it may be a useful reference for any product manager working in government. This guide communicates what to expect from a product manager on your team, as well as an understanding of what your team expects from product managers. This guide offers a resource for product management best practices at 18F across multiple phases and types of consulting work.

## Product Management at 18F

As a PM at 18F, you will find yourself in a client-facing consulting role to help a government partner build or buy a mission-critical product. As we work across the entire federal government and can now support state and local governments, you may encounter subject matter that is entirely new to you. Or, you may be working on one of TTS’ flagship products, like [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/), [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) or [login.gov](https://login.gov/). In all cases, you will develop and steward a product vision and strategy, and drive a cross-functional team to deliver the right product to the right audience. This involves different activities and priorities at different phases of the work—whether you're in discovery or implementation mode—you are creating the space and opportunity for your team to deliver on intended outcomes, rooted in evidence.

## Sustainability and product ownership

At 18F, our unique approach ensures our agency partners build or buy sustainably, and create a culture of long-term, government-led product ownership. Anything we build or help our partners buy, should empower our partner agencies to better meet their mission, be relatively easy to adopt and support, and deliver value to end users. The ways we deliver technology will allow partner agencies to successfully practice product ownership in government on their own. This is accomplished through product coaching, and described in detail in the [Coach the product owner]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/coach/) section.

## Frameworks to guide our work

Our product managers tend to be experts in several frameworks that drive the approach we bring to our work, both enabling serve low-risk, successful technology projects in government:

1. **[Agile delivery](https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/federal-field-guide/basic-principles/#agile-software-development)**: iterative development of functional software, continuous deployment and testing.

2. **[User-centered design](https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/federal-field-guide/basic-principles/#user-centered-design)**: design with, not for the users of a system or government service.

3. **[Build and communicate in the open](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/07/the-need-for-transparency-in-government/)**: transparency is key to building trust.

4. **[Low-risk technology acquisition](https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/federal-field-guide/basic-principles/#modular-contracting)**: we work to ensure that purchasing software services or off the shelf products is low risk and contracts are structured modularly.
