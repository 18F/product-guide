This guide is for people at 18F who are wondering what to expect from a product manager on their team, as well as for product managers and those filling that role to understand what their team expects from them. This guide also serves as a resource for product management best practices at 18F (generalized to apply to any of the specific types of product work we do, like Custom Partner Solutions (CPS) projects, product or platform work, Acquisition projects, consulting, etc.)
