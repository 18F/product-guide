Before we dig deeper into what project intake means for a product lead, take a minute to familiarize yourself with the basics by checking out the [18F Intake guide](https://pages.18f.gov/intake/) and [All Things 18F Intake](https://hub.18f.gov/private/intake/). This guide will introduce you to the various people and components of the intake process, including:

-   Business Development Team members 
-   The [#project-intake](https://18f.slack.com/archives/project-intake) channel on Slack
-   Our [recommendation document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2ZsnWDN9gYwIVTrVYwFcud4JNJfBc6edxbOB9ZKnWo/edit) that we use to evaluate project alignment with 18F
-   How we track and work with clients (outlined in the [18F Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/) and the [18F Opportunity Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQMf2lt7jtrTVSh02UmK_l5nqVF7TE44fbHwB-IM4qI/edit#gid=964099770))
-   The [intake agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssFdsuGLA_ZQt286ZZeeaXuhuqpNUa5ETY6dx-hXZOI/edit) that is updated and reviewed in our weekly intake standups
-   How projects are currently being resourced

The Business Development team has made the 18F intake process wonderfully transparent and makes details of the process available to all in our weekly intake meeting and the [Project Intake & Selection folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B84F26FpUP0lVkUyeTh1OEpqc2c) on the 18F Team Google Drive. By doing so, everybody at 18F can glean information as to why and how we take on various projects.

In advance of a project coming to Intake, the Business Development Team typically spends anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours discussing the project with the potential client to determine whether 18F is a good fit for their needs. If there’s enough time, the Business Development Team will help to define the scope and objective(s) of the project prior to bringing the project to intake. 

Coming out of intake, the Business Development Team works with the delivery and consulting directors to assign a team to a project, including a product lead (you!). Going to the weekly intake meeting and communicating regularly with the director of product about projects coming in to 18F will help you get matched with a project that’s a good fit for you.

Because the client relationship has been managed by the Business Development Team through the intake process, you as the project lead can learn more from them about the client and project. Assuming that 18F decides to move forward with a project, the first formal opportunity to dig deeper will be during a technical evaluation.
