###Web Design Standards 
When developing new products, we work to use and reuse defined standards. One pioneering example of government-wide design standards is the alpha release of the draft [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) penned by 18F and USDS. The goal of the design standards is to create a more unified and holistic experience to visitors across government sites, provide examples and guidance on best practices in interaction patterns and accessibility, and to allow product teams to stand-up prototypes and websites more quickly. While they’re not a requirement, if an agency doesn’t already have an established style guide, the draft U.S. Web Design Standards can help save time, money, and effort. If you see something that needs to be updated, file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards). If you have questions, ping the team in [#web-design-standards](https://18f.slack.com/messages/web-design-standards/). 

###Accessibility and 508 standards
As government technologists, we must do everything within our power to serve all of our constituencies, regardless of ability. As part of that goal, we must offer accessible digital content and products that follow the government’s [508 standards](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards) for accessibility. In order to meet these standards, we follow the [WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Accessibility standards should be incorporated early and often in a project to ensure a usable, compliant product. Before a product launch, please make sure to review [the 18F 508 checklist](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/checklist).

Accessibility standards help our audience make sure they can use our digital properties, from people who use screen readers to those with color blindness. Following these standards also helps us write code that is cleaner, more organized, faster-loading, and more search engine-friendly. 

18F’s own Nick Bristow is an expert in this area and can offer guidance if you find problems that your team can’t tackle. You can also read through our [Accessibility Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/) or get guidance from the Accessibility Guild in [#g-accessibility](https://18f.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/). The goal of the Accessibility Guild is to help us develop good, accessible products from the start of production in order to provide an excellent user experience for everyone. 

###Design Method Cards
18F’s design team has prepared a pool of tools to help work with clients on agile product development called the [Design Method Cards](https://methods.18f.gov/). These tools offer ways for teams to collaborate with stakeholders on [Discovering](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/), [Deciding](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/), [Making](https://methods.18f.gov/make/), and [Validating](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/) designs, products, and research. They’re produced with agile product development in government in mind, so there are lots of great tips and information about the Paperwork Reduction Act, privacy, and other challenges.

The tools are available as physical cards (ask the Director of Design if there’s a deck available) or digitally here:

-   [View or save all the cards (PDF)](https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta-Preview.pdf)
-   [Print the cards, at home or professionally — complete with instructions (ZIP)](https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta_Print.zip)
-   [Customize the Adobe InDesign template to fit your needs (INDD)](https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta-Template.zip)

If you have questions or suggestions, head over to [#design-methods](https://18f.slack.com/messages/design-methods/).

###Open source 
One of 18F’s founding principles is to take advantage of open source software development. Open source software facilitates cross-agency and industry sharing, provides extraordinary cost savings, and increases our impact. We always default to open source because:

**Transparency leads to trust.**

-   It builds public trust in the development of the application and the interests represented, since those are visible in GitHub.
-   It builds trust between 18F and the agency partner(s), since everyone’s work is open and accessible to others.
-   It builds trust within the government, since the work is public from day one and we can reference methods and ideas from project to project without worrying about revealing inappropriate information.

**Open source streamlines work.**

-   Working in the open helps to encourage good documentation and coding practices.
-   Everyone is aware and following processes for open information from day one.
-   There is no just-before-launch, last minute reviews of everything. All code and documentation is reviewed as it’s developed.
-   Open source repositories allow for an easy and accessible source of truth for pulling in additional experts to check out a problem.
-   The pre-launch and post-launch process is the same, which optimizes workflow.

**Working in the open streamlines communication.**

-   Easy internal communications without the need to access permissions, account creation, etc.
-   Key partners have access to information without back-and-forth email approvals and account creation and authorization.

**Open source saves the government and the public money and time.**

-   Sharing code and allowing other agencies to build, reuses, reshare, and contribute to our open source platforms allows us to save time and money and work together collaboratively, rather than in silos.
-   Open source is not proprietary and tied to any specific vendor or system, so a properly-documented project can be maintained by many different people.

###Content
Government websites contain a lot of content, much of which can be filled with confusing acronyms, legalese, and regulatory or legal jargon. At 18F, we strive to create content that is user-focused and easily to understand, both because it’s the right thing to do and because [plain language is the law](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/).

Use the [18F Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/) as you create any type of content, from a blog post to site copy. Following the best practices outlined in the guide will ensure that your readers are easily able to understand your message. You can also ask for guidance in [#g-content](https://18f.slack.com/messages/g-content/) or short term help in [#writing-lab](https://18f.slack.com/messages/writing_lab/). The Content Guild promotes concise, elegant, user-centered writing and plans for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content.

###Product testing
Part of the agile process is testing the products we build after every sprint demo, taking that feedback, and iteratively improving. Along with that constant iterative testing and feedback loop, we encourage thorough automated testing as an integrated development practice to catch bugs and errors early. This improves the stability of our applications and enables end-of-sprint manual testing to focus on improving the customer experience of everything we build.

18F has extensive documentation for a [Testing Cookbook](https://pages.18f.gov/testing-cookbook/), [Automated Testing Resources](https://pages.18f.gov/automated-testing-playbook/), and soon, we’ll have an 18F/OCSIT Mobile Device Testing Library in the D.C. GSA office (for more hands-on device testing). The [#wg-testing group](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-testing/) can also help you. The testing working group aims to ensure the long-term success of 18F development projects by cultivating the best automated testing tools, practices, and training materials.
