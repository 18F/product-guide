Once you have a vision, you need to align on how to realize it. It’s helpful to use one of the many strategic frameworks (such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Win-Strategy-Really-Works/dp/1491528796" target="_blank">Lafley Cascade</a> or <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank">Mission Model Canvas</a>) to help the team think about what elements to consider in your strategy and how they may relate to one another.

The classic expression of product strategy is a roadmap, which details a sequence of measurable goals and expected outcomes. An agile roadmap will evolve throughout the life of any product you are working on, but should always represent the latest strategic thinking. Make it public and be clear about the bets you are making, who they are designed to help, and how you know you will win or lose. Your roadmap should be designed to meet the specific needs of your project’s internal and external stakeholders  and may look different from other project’s roadmaps in terms of structure and presentation. 

Because we are agile in our approach, it’s important for the everyone to understand that **a roadmap is not a promise: it is a prediction**, subject to change and typically created with the best available, yet imperfect, information. Take time with the team and stakeholders at regular intervals (every three months or so) to re-evaluate your strategy and make sure you all understand whether you are moving in the right direction. This ensures that everyone is already aligned if and when you have to pivot in a different direction.

When you are working on a TTS product or platform, you may also need to ensure that your product has a pricing, marketing and business strategy that aligns with your product goals. Like the roadmap, these should be iterative and measurable.
