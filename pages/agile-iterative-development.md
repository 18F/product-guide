parent: Working in a way that reflects our values
---
At 18F, we have learned that value is best delivered on government software projects by using <a href="https://agile.18f.gov/" target="_blank">agile and iterative</a> product development. By working closely with stakeholders, regularly delivering small pieces of the build, verifying direction and progress, and then adjusting or building new pieces, we’re able to track our progress and course-correct easily before sunk costs grow.

Building with iterative cycles allows us to develop lean products that save cost, deliver quickly, and directly serve customer needs.

We aim to deliver in increments so we can learn just enough to inform the next iteration. Part of the agile process is building small pieces, testing these with users to verify the product is working and valid, and then build more with that informed view.

We aim to deliver clear value. We don’t want to waste time, resources, or money on unnecessary features, so we rapidly build small increments and then test them to verify the solutions are working for users, and if not, we rebuild or research new solutions and test those until the user is satisfied.
