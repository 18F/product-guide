Agile product development requires <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/" target="_blank">continuous delivery of value</a> to real users (if you aren’t deploying to production, you aren’t doing Agile). Continuous delivery means that instead of big-bang production releases every 6 months or longer, value is delivered frequently (usually every 2 weeks) in real life production situations, so teams can get the actionable feedback that fuels iteration.

And, continuous delivery implies that software is never ‘complete’, and can only serve its users if they are involved from the very beginning, and continually throughout the life of the product. 

As a product manager, you will need to understand all of these implications and show our clients how this way of working is critical to the success of their product. <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/01/25/getting-devops-buy-in/" target="_blank">Take a look at this blog post for ideas on how to set the stage for continuous delivery</a>.
