Agile product development requires continuous delivery of software to real users. Continuous delivery means that instead of big-bang production releases every 6 months or longer, value is delivered frequently (usually every 2 weeks) in real life production situations, so that actual users can provide the feedback that fuels iteration.

And, continuous delivery implies that software is never ‘complete’, and can only serve its users if they are involved from the very beginning, and then continually throughout the life of the product.
 
As a product manager, you will need to understand all of these implications and show our clients how this way of working is critical to the success of their product.
