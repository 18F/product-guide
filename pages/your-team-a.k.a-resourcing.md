As 18F grows and takes on more projects, it can sometimes be challenging to obtain full-time resources for individual projects. Know that 18F will not say yes to a project nor will we start work until we can identify a dedicated team for that project. 

You are not on your own when it comes to finding the resources you may need. When you’re assigned as a product lead to a particular project, you’ll also be assigned a team for the initial scope of work. If/when that scope changes or you’ve noticed a shift in your resourcing needs, make sure the delivery directors are aware of these changes. It’s important to note that resourcing is currently a known problem area that we’re working to address. 

**TL;DR - Always go through these processes instead of soliciting work from individual engineers and designers.** This ensures that our project work remains organized and individuals don’t take on more work than they can handle.

###Resourcing developers
Feel free to post an [opportunity](https://openopps.digitalgov.gov/), make sure to tag it with “18F”, and promote it in appropriate Slack channels. If other federal employees are interested in the project, you’re welcome to accept them as helpers or you can prefer a dedicated 18F staffer, but you do need to engage or reject people based on actual qualifications.

###Resourcing designers
The design director will assign you specific people through the intake resourcing process or let you know when they will be available.

###Resourcing user research
If you don’t have a dedicated researcher on your team, make sure to drop into [#research](https://18f.slack.com/messages/research/) for guidance. Folks from the Research Guild will be happy to review your research plan and provide feedback. The Research Guild promotes best practices at 18F and in the rest of the government.

###Onboarding new team members
As a product lead, it’s important that you invest some time from the very start in getting your new team members acclimated to your team and processes. You want the team to feel empowered and comfortable with agile as well as with one another. Take the opportunity during your first few meetings and sprint plannings to make sure everybody is on the same page. Do not expect everything to make sense to everybody from the very start.

In some cases, you’ll be welcoming new members onto your team once your project has already gotten started. Be sure to take the time to thoughtfully acclimate them to agile and the team processes so that they feel comfortable diving in.

###Distributed teamwork
One of the benefits of working at 18F is that we have colleagues all over the country. This means that oftentimes you may find yourself working on a project that has several remote employees. While working with a remote team can be a challenge, 18F has some great tools to make remote work less stressful for you. Read our [Guide to Distributed Teamwork](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ozBoXxTnWutvp63mr5Q8phN21IRFD3LYm3BtgYkQg0/edit), as well as [this awesome blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/) about our best practices in the area and [this GitHub page](https://github.com/18F/handbook/blob/staging/articles/2-about-us/offices/distributed.md) with really helpful tools and suggestions to get you started. Overcommunication, regular team retrospectives, and adapting workflows as needed really help bring a team together, especially one not working face to face. Know that you have many colleagues with experience in this area, and you should always feel free to speak up and ask for help if you’re running into challenges.
