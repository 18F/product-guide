title: We Help Our Partners Do Product By Themselves
---
The role of product is new to government, but is critical to the success of our mission. Our partners must understand this and allot the resources and time to making sure this work is done. Specifically, when working with a partner agency, a big part of the job is to make sure that they establish internal teams that are set up to continue solid product management practices throughout the engagement and after we leave. A product that dies when we walk away is a failed product.

To be successful, partners must be able to continue to articulate a compelling vision to their users and stakeholders. They must be able to continue create an iterative strategy that delivers value quickly while identifying and mitigating larger risks. They must continue to fail fast and learn the right lessons from these failures so that they can regularly deliver value to their users and stakeholders. 

Encourage your partner to take over product communications as early as possible. Model best practices and then transition that work to them. Sending ship reports, publishing release notes and blogging or tweeting publicly about their own work will help them get used to telling their product story so that they are already comfortable doing this by the time the engagement ends.

Developing strong product management capacity with our partners can take some time, so we should start coaching from day zero. By the time the engagement ends, we should be walking away from a product teams that are already healthy and functional. What this looks like will be different for each engagement, but an 18F product manager will need to lead this effort and make sure it happens early and continuously.
