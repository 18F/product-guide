title: Product Managment at 18F
---

As a product manager at 18F, you may be put in a client facing role, where you will be helping a government partner build a product to create a particular impact or solve a particular problem. You may also be working on one of 18F’s flagship products, like [eRegs](https://eregs.github.io/), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/sites), [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) or [login.gov](https://login.gov/). You may be leading a team of designers and engineers to build a custom solution, or you may be working with contract specialists and vendors to acquire a solution for a government partner. In all cases, you will be driving the product vision and strategy, and ensuring delivery of the right product to the right people.

Some other ways to think about the role include that we:

- make sure that there is a strategy, and they also make sure that the strategy actually happens
- decide what the work is and what the work isn’t
- lead, or orchestrate, the larger team to deliver the right thing to the right customers
- are the "CEO" of the product, as the technical lead is the "CTO" of the product

We are NOT the following roles, yet we understand which ones are needed to deliver the right product. We are responsible for filling those roles even if we don’t have all the actual role-players on our team. That means that PMs sometimes wear one or more of the following hats in order to fill a need on the team (sometimes your team really needs coffee). **At the end of the day, PMs do whatever it takes to make sure the right product goes out the door.**

## Summary

The role of a Product Manager is broad, not deep. In practice, product managers come from different backgrounds/specialties (design, engineering, marketing, sales, business development) and may do different things day-to-day at different companies, depending on their level of expertise in an area, or their level of support in other areas. Product Managers are always connected to the business, will always own the vision, and will be primarily concerned with leading teams to bring the vision together with strategy and delivery.
