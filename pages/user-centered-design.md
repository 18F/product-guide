User-centered design ensures that we’re delivering value to users by putting them at the center of our problem solving, rather than one that’s solely focused on stakeholders. Researchers help us deeply understand the people that our products serve. UX designers craft thoughtful, inclusive solutions. Specialists in visual design and content strategy help us communicate effectively with everyone in our audience.

Design is not just how the product looks, but rather how it works, and how people use and interact with the product. At 18F, designers are strategic partners who help us shape the solutions we deliver. 

We make space for design to iterate, so that we can be sure we’re delivering the right product to the right audience. Instead of operating off of assumptions about our users, we document and test our hypotheses. This drives down risk and improves the quality of the end product.
