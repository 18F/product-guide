title: Measurement and Iteration
parent: We Do Product Well

We don’t just deliver exceptional digital services; we also aim to strengthen government technology practices in ways that last beyond our formal partnerships.  How do we know that we are delivering on those goals as our projects unfold?

Keep in mind that our partners may be very new to how we work and the transformations we want to instill. Metrics enable our partners to better visualize the value that we are delivering.

Keep in mind that:

- We should look at metrics that track both the delivery of exceptional digital services and whether we are effecting lasting change with our partner agency.
- These metrics can be qualitative and quantitative.
- Measuring is a habit that should be established early.

Interpreting metrics throughout the project can be tricky (and subjective). However, having this barometer enables you to make informed decisions and adjustments to the team’s execution for future iterations.
