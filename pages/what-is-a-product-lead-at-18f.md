title: What is a Product Lead at 18F?
---
Product leads can wear a lot of different hats, but more than anything, a product lead is truly responsible for making sure that every role is being played by somebody on the team in order to move the project forward. A product lead can take on any one of the following roles, but a team member who’s interested in learning more about being a product lead can also scrub in on one of these roles:

**Account liaison.** Maintain the relationship, budget, and project status communications with the agency partner. You’ll be working with 18F Finance, 18F Infrastructure, and the partner agency on maintaining the project budget. Find out more in the [18F Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/) as well as our guide on [How 18F Manages Client Accounts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PIgWhoAifBmx6K-ihh8h9HRPQz1Mlj0TKHWv-UNWE-4/edit) (this is the official “control document” describing how 18F conducts business). Continuously think about: 

-   Are we setting (and resetting) expectations well for the people paying for this product? 
-   Do they understand the value of our process (not just what we’re delivering)? 
-   Are they learning?

**Project manager.** Maintain the schedule and estimate resource and budget needs. There are no standard project management tools for product managers; you can use software on [the approved list](https://hub.18f.gov/private/tools/), spreadsheets, etc. [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/teamops) also has a number of resources available to you. It’s really about finding what works for you and the team. Continuously think about:

-   Do we have enough of the right kind of skills on the team? Coordinate with development and design directors on team resources.
-   Are project risks being tracked and mitigated?
-   Do the team members know what is expected of them, and can they deliver?

**Agile coach** for the team. Champion agile practices and behaviors from all the team members so that the team feels empowered and comfortable with agile and could theoretically coach themselves. See more in the agile section below. Continuously think about: 

-   Do we have small stories that we can deliver iteratively?
-   Are we continuously improving our process?

**Product evangelist.** Share with others the value of the product you’re working to deliver and why it’s so important. Continuously think about: 

-   Does the product have a clear problem statement, and is it delivering a solution that works for the users?
-   Are we communicating what the product is, its success, and what we’re learning inside of 18F, as well as externally via blogging?
-   Is the project welcoming to the open source community?
-   Do we have a good pipeline of prospective users?

**Product owner** from an agile perspective. Create the user stories, prioritize the backlog, and accept stories when they’re completed. Depending on the nature of the project and the agency partner, there can be shades of grey here: in some projects we'll be working with a product owner that has a very clear vision for the project; in other cases, we may be taking on more of a leadership role. 

In either scenario, our work should ALWAYS be highly collaborative. We shouldn't make decisions or build things in a vacuum and for the same reasons, it’s important that the agency partner "own" the solution and are actively engaged in how we get there. If that commitment isn't there at kickoff, we strive to coach our stakeholders on how they can contribute to the agile process. Continuously think about: 

-   Are we building the right product?
-   Is there a well groomed and prioritized backlog?
-   Are we testing our assumptions and hypotheses?

**Quality champion** in all facets of the project and always championing for our users. When it comes to engineering, encourage developers to write good unit tests and integration tests, maintain technical documentation, and follow general development best practices. Our engineers are very talented, and explicitly championing these things signals to them that they should spend time on tests and documentation in the course of their daily work. While our engineers are usually already thinking about tests, you’re a backstop for those who feel time or other pressures. Ultimately, you’re a backstop for quality in all areas, whether it be [lean product design](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/), development, usability testing, or other components of the project. Continuously think about: 

-   Do we have sufficient automation in testing and deployment to effectively support our agile process?
-   Can we test live software with real users before and after launch?
-   Are we making the right [technical debt tradeoffs](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/technical-debt/)?  
-   Is the product accessible?
