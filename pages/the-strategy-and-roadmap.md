Once you have a vision, you need to align on how to realize it. It’s helpful to use one of the many strategic frameworks (such as the Lafley Cascade or Mission Model Canvas) to help the team think about what elements to consider in your strategy and how they may relate to one another.

The classic expression of product strategy is a roadmap, which you should build and maintain throughout the life of any product you are working on. Make it public and be clear about the bets you are making, who they are designed to help, and how you know you will win or lose. A roadmap needs to document a sequence of outcomes at a high enough fidelity to speak clearly to a variety of audiences without getting into the granular details of a product backlog. It will be a critical tool for communicating progress internally and externally.

Because we are agile in our approach, it’s important for the everyone to understand that a roadmap is not a promise: it is a prediction, subject to change and typically created with the best available, yet imperfect, information. Take time with the team and stakeholders at regular intervals (every three months or so) to re-evaluate your strategy and make sure you all understand whether you are moving in the right direction. This ensures that everyone is already aligned if and when you have to pivot in a different direction.

When you are working on a TTS product or platform, you may also need to ensure that your product has a pricing, marketing and business strategy that aligns with your product goals. Like the roadmap, these should be iterative and measurable.
