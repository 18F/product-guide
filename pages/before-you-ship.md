An Authority to Operate (ATO) is a risk management process that **you must start and complete** before you can deploy a production system publicly on the web. Learn more about it in the [ATO section of the Before You Ship guide](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/). You should review this documentation as soon as you _start_ a project. You can ask for help in [#compliance-toolkit](https://18f.slack.com/archives/compliance-toolkit).

Despite the “Before You Ship” name, everything in [18F's Before You Ship guide](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/) should be considered early and often. This guide is especially helpful when you’re starting to consider a project launch or feature release. This is not solely a last-minute, pre-launch checklist. If you have questions, the guide lists pertinent Slack channels.
