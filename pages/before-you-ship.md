An Authority to Operate (ATO) is a risk management process that **you must start and complete** before you can deploy a production system publicly on the web. Learn more about it in the [ATO section of the Before You Ship guide](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/). You should review this documentation **as soon as you _start_ a project**. You can ask for help in [#cloud-gov-highbar](https://18f.slack.com/archives/cloud-gov-highbar).

Despite the “Before You Ship” name, everything in [18F's Before You Ship guide](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/) should be considered early and often. This guide is especially helpful when you’re starting to consider a project launch or feature release. This is not solely a last-minute, pre-launch checklist. If you have questions, the guide lists other pertinent Slack channels.

Currently, 18F is taking at least *6 weeks to issue ATOs*. This is based upon final submission of _completeting_ the [Before You Ship](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/) guide to signed ATO. The length from submission to signature is mainly due to processes inside of GSA IT that 18F does not control, and cannot predict. You should not create any expectations on the public launch of systems until you have a signed ATO in hand.
