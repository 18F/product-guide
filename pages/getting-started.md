Before we dig into the world of product at 18F, here are a few tips and tools to help you along the way: 

-   Head over to the [#product](https://18f.slack.com/messages/product) channel in Slack where your fellow product leads have lots to share. They can offer suggestions or help point you in the right direction when you’re stuck. Review the [18F Org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kM5YWcvlHBZpQNTpGefmtbfxTV866u935qrdpj7HrJE/edit) to remind you of who’s on the Product Team and get an idea of the other teams at 18F.
-   At 18F, we strive to follow agile best practices in all our work. The Agile Guild has written up an [Agile Principles & Practices](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/) guide, which is a good primer on agile at 18F. The Agile Guild improves the quality and speed of service delivery through process improvement by encouraging the use of iterative methods in research, planning, and development of solutions we implement, and is always sharing lots of helpful tips and tools. You can find the Agile Guild at [#g-agile](https://18f.slack.com/messages/g-agile/).
-   You’re going to have some time on your hands when you first get started. There are great benefits to scrubbing in on other projects while waiting to get assigned to one as a product lead. Use this as an opportunity to get to know your colleagues and the way we work. We suggest, however, that you resist the urge to dig too deep into design or development on a particular project since you’ll want to be ready to hit the ground running when your own project starts. 
-   There are so many helpful tools, you simply need to know where to look. Quite often you’ll find some of our best resources on GitHub, like our [API Standards](https://github.com/18F/api-standards) or the [Front End Style Guide](https://github.com/18F/frontend). Feel free to ask questions in [#g-frontend](https://18f.slack.com/messages/g-frontend/), where our Front End Guild is working on improving 18F front end code quality through camaraderie and guidelines. Look around on [18F’s GitHub repos](https://github.com/18F). If something doesn’t make sense either in content or organization, feel free to file an issue.
-   Don’t assume our partners and clients know why we’re doing what we’re doing or using the processes and tools that we use. Be willing and open to explaining these tools using such resources as our [18F Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/). For example, “We’re building these features because you prioritized this area, and our user has conveyed that this will help them achieve their goal.”
-   If you’re looking for a specific outcome on a project or problem, frame your workflow so that others will have to go out of their way to prevent said outcome instead of needing explicit approval (with the exception of formal processes like getting an [Authority to Operate a.k.a. ATO]({{ site.baseurl }}/lifecycle-of-a-project/before-you-ship/)). This will make things move much more swiftly and efficiently. (Ex. - “We’re going to do X unless we hear otherwise” instead of “Please approve X.”)
