title: Welcome to 18F
---

Beginning your tenure at 18F is a lot like learning a language via immersion. During your first month, you’re going to do a lot of quizzical pointing and relying on the kindness of strangers. Rest assured that your team understands that your first month will be filled with form-filling, onboarding, and generally getting settled. Spend your first month thinking about and doing the following things:

-   Read [this checklist](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Checklists/team-based-checklists/product-new-hire-checklist.md) for new product team members, and take the time to complete each item. If you don’t understand it, don’t worry, just ask somebody for help in [#product](https://18f.slack.com/messages/product).
-   Say yes to all the video meetings, workgroups, and guilds to which you’re invited. You can reject them later, but for right now, you want all the exposure you can get. 
-   Listen and ask or write down questions as you have them. [#questions](https://18f.slack.com/messages/questions/) is a good place for general help and [#wg-documentation](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-documentation/) can help you find written documentation on 18F practices or policies. Our [documentation working group](https://pages.18f.gov/wg-documentation/) exists to specifically improve the comprehensiveness, quality, and tooling of documentation at 18F.
-   Take the mandatory GSA trainings and all of the onboarding classes in [#18f-classes](https://18f.slack.com/messages/18f-classes/). This is when you actually have the time to make these a priority. Both are not specific to the Product Team, but they’re incredibly useful. You can learn more about the onboarding working group by visiting [#wg-onboarding](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-onboarding/) where we’re working on methods to improve the onboarding process at 18F.
-   Check out the [18F Org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kM5YWcvlHBZpQNTpGefmtbfxTV866u935qrdpj7HrJE/edit) and schedule one-on-one coffees with various 18F team members. Start with the Product Team, then anybody who says something interesting in your earshot. Get to know people. You absorb a lot about this place from those coffees. 
-   Familiarize yourself with the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and the [18F Core Values](https://pages.18f.gov/core-values/), and ask any questions you may have in [#wg-code-of-conduct](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-code-of-conduct/) or [#wg-core-values](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-core-values/). Our code of conduct working group maintains the code and are committed to enforcing it and helping resolve issues. Our core values working group helps us to create a shared understanding of values that drive our work and are continuously iterating on how our practices reflect those values.
-   Know that there are lots of opportunities for training during your time at 18F. You can learn more about this in [#wg-training](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-training/) where our training working group maintains a place for all of the different training initiatives to share information, ask questions, and talk about different trainings we’re experimenting with.
-   Most importantly of all, take your time. There is no rush. Use your first month to get acclimated to our culture, our pace, and our way of working with one another. Everyone has been right where you are. 

When you get to your third or fourth week at 18F, that’s when you’re ready to come back and read this guide again. You’ll have started to scrub in on some projects, and you’ll be able to put this guide into context.
