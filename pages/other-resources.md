This guide exists to offer you best practices, recommendations, and resources to better inform your work. 

One of the great ways 18F shares this knowledge is through our working groups and guilds, including those that we’ve referenced in the other sections of this guide. You can find lots more about our working groups and guilds in the [18F Handbook](handbook.18f.gov) and by visiting [#wg-working_groups](https://18f.slack.com/messages/wg-working_groups/). Our working group for working groups is dedicated to creating an environment in which working groups and guilds can thrive and have a meaningful impact on 18F deliverables and operations. 

Here’s some basic information on those working groups and guilds that we haven’t previously covered:

###Code reviews

We create shared expectations around code reviews to consistently improve code quality and to hone our skills as developers.

###Diversity

We help make 18F a great place to work for people of all backgrounds.
