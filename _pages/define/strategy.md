Once you have a vision, you need to align on how to realize it. It’s helpful to think about what elements to consider in your strategy and how they may relate to one another.

## Considerations: A good strategy...

- Clearly articulates the short-term and long-term goals and how they will help the partner achieve their vision

- Explains the value proposition of the recommended approach and the tradeoffs associated with alternatives

- Has realistic technology maintenance and staffing implications for the partner

- Is developed with input from subject matter experts from the project team and partner and ensures that stakeholders are aligned and prepared to execute on the strategy

## Activities: How to get there

- Work with your partner to develop measurable, flexible, and adaptable goals that tie into the vision.

- Identify options for the future "to-be" state and articulate the factors that differentiate the options.

- Refer to pain points, opportunities, or priorities identified during discovery to develop criteria to evaluate and compare the options.

- Think about market differentiation as it relates to your product’s value proposition (e.g. competitors, build/buy analysis, existing systems, how tech changed over time, etc.)

- Identify, inform, and engage stakeholders that can provide additional resources, including decisions around legal/policy, compliance, technical, or security matters.

- Work with your engineering lead to secure alignment on the technology stack that will be used, where the product will be hosted, how a continuous integration and deployment pipeline will be established, and how an Authority to Operate (ATO) will be secured.

- Work with your acquisitions lead to consider whether the work can be performed and sustained via the agency’s current team or if the agency needs to acquire additional support (in-house or via vendor).

- Agree on a path forward and the value proposition with the partner.

## Incorporation: What to do next

- Be ready to speak to the value of the proposed product or service to a variety of audiences.

- Develop an actionable roadmap to execute on the vision and strategy.

- Regularly reconsider the strategy and adapt goals based on changing circumstances, external inputs, or new directions.
