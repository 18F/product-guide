A vision statement acts as a north star that motivates and guides the team, conveying the overarching goal the team is aiming for. It lets everyone tell the same story, with the same passion and conviction. It’s also a short “elevator pitch” that helps you communicate clearly about the value of the work you’re doing to anyone at any time so you can quickly galvanize support.

While you can undoubtedly come up with a great vision for the project all by yourself, it’s not sustainable—because you’re going to walk away from this project and leave it in your partner’s hands. Our goal is to help our partners grow their internal practices, and teaching them how to set a strong vision is an important step on that journey. You will revisit and may adjust your vision at times as you learn more, but maintaining a clear, inclusive vision is critical to product success.


### Considerations: A good vision statement...

- Is clear, concise, informative, and inspirational.

- Is aspirational yet achievable; it should provide direction for years, not months.

- Makes clear the problem you are solving, who you are trying to help, how you will help, and the outcome you hope to achieve.

- Indicates why your solution is different or better than others.

- Focuses on outcomes and objectives, rather than specific implementation details

- Supports the broader goals of the organization.

- Has buy-in and commitment from the development team, executive sponsors, and any other key participants.

### Activities: How to get there

- Connect the vision to the problem statement to articulate the problem you are solving and why it is meaningful.

- Understand who you are solving for and what matters to them.

- Identify the key differentiators that make this solution better than the current state or existing alternatives.

- Identify measurable outcomes that communicate the positive impact of the intended changes and help you determine if you’re on the right track.


### Incorporation: What to do next

- Document the vision and keep it visible and central. Refer to it regularly.

- Regularly reconsider the vision and update as appropriate.
