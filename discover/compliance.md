title: Understand the regulatory landscape
---

Laws, regulations, and policies may obligate or constrain what your partners are able to do.  You are likely to be told "that's the way we have to do it" or "we're not allowed to do it any other way."  It will be important for you to understand what is truly legally required versus what is "just the way it's always been done" so you can help your partners stay in compliance while also cutting through unnecessary layers of bureaucracy.   

Below are some outcomes 18F product managers drive when understanding the regulatory landscape:

-   Define the regulatory authority used in the current process and why it is used

-   Identify the policy and procedural requirements and/or restrictions that will influence planning for the future state

-   Understand the people, decisions, processes, and tools the current team has put in place to satisfy these requirements
