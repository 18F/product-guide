title: Measure success
---
We don’t just deliver exceptional digital services; we also aim to strengthen government technology practices in ways that last beyond our formal partnerships. How do we know that we are delivering on those goals as we build?

Keep in mind that our partners may be very new to how we work and the transformations we want to instill. Metrics enable our partners to better visualize the value that we are delivering. 

Interpreting metrics throughout the project can be tricky (and subjective). However, having this barometer enables you to make informed decisions and adjustments to the team’s execution for future iterations.

Below are some outcomes 18F product managers drive in this area:

- Goals, outcomes, and targets have appropriate, realistic measures indicating how we’ll know when they’re met
- Metrics are used to forecast and adjust the trajectory of the project
- The state of the project can be reported in terms of measurable indicators at any time
