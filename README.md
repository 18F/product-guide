## 18F Product Guide

You’ve been asked to serve as a product lead at 18F — now what? This guide will walk you through what it’s like to be a product lead at 18F and offer some tools you can use along the way. Whatever tools you decide to use are up to you and your team.

Product leads are regularly learning lessons throughout their project’s lifecycle. Please share lessons learned with your peers so that we may all benefit from them. Sharing what you learn means our team only has to solve a problem once.  Whether you [add that information here](https://github.com/18F/product-guide/issues/new) or [write a blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/04/29/18f-how-we-write/) — your avenue for sharing it is up to you!
