title: Enable partners
---
Product management is new to government, and it is critical to the success of our mission. Our partners must understand this and allot the necessary resources and time to ensure they can manage their products by themselves. So, when working with a partner agency, a big part of your job will be helping partners set up and sustain product teams and solid product development practices so that they can take over after we leave. A product that dies when we walk away is a failed product.
