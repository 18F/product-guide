As Product Managers at 18F, we adopt a user-centric approach to our work.  We value understanding who may be affected or impacted by our work, what their current experience is, and what their needs are so that our teams are focused on solving problems for them.  We bring together the voice of the user with an understanding of our partnersâ€™ business, technical, and regulatory needs to feed our vision for a better future.
